Me:
Now that I’ve got the weather data retrieval and response generation working, I want to improve the user interface. I’m thinking about using pyinputplus to handle input validation. I also want to add more detailed error messages. Can you help me structure the menu system with input validation for the location?

AI:
Great! pyinputplus is a good choice for input validation. You can set up a menu system where the user is prompted to enter a location, and you’ll validate that the input is not empty and is a valid string. Here’s a sample menu structure:

import pyinputplus as pyip

def get_location_input():
    location = pyip.inputMenu(
        ['Paris', 'London', 'New York', 'Tokyo', 'Sydney'], numbered=True, caseSensitive=True,
        prompt='Please choose a location:\n', blank=False
    )
    return location

def display_menu():
    while True:
        print("\nWeather Advisor Menu:")
        print("1. Get Weather Information")
        print("2. Exit")
        
        choice = pyip.inputChoice([1, 2], prompt="Enter your choice: ", caseSensitive=True)
        
        if choice == 1:
            location = get_location_input()
            print(f"You selected {location}. Fetching weather data...")
            # Add code to retrieve weather data here
        elif choice == 2:
            print("Exiting Weather Advisor. Goodbye!")
            break


In this example, inputMenu() validates that the user selects a valid location from the list. You can modify this to allow free-form text input and validate the location with a weather API later.

Me:
This looks good! I want to add more flexibility, like allowing the user to enter a custom location if it’s not on the predefined list. How can I modify this to let the user type in any city name?

AI:
To allow custom location input, you can switch from inputMenu() to inputStr() for a free-form string input and validate it based on some basic criteria, like checking if the string isn’t empty or contains only letters. Here's an updated version:

def get_location_input():
    location = pyip.inputStr(
        prompt="Enter the city for the weather forecast: ", allowRegexes=[r'^[A-Za-z\s]+$']
    )
    return location


This will allow the user to type in any city, and the input will be validated to ensure it contains only letters and spaces. You can later validate this location with the weather API to ensure it's a valid location.

Me:
Nice, I’ll integrate that. Next, I want to handle scenarios where the weather API call fails, such as when the location doesn't return valid weather data. How can I gracefully handle this error and notify the user?

AI:
You should include a check to ensure that the API returns valid data. If the data is missing or incomplete, you can return a helpful error message to the user. Here’s how you can handle that:

def get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5):
    try:
        url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1"
        response = requests.get(url)
        
        if response.status_code != 200:
            raise ValueError(f"Error: Unable to retrieve data for {location}. Status code: {response.status_code}")
        
        weather_data = response.json()
        if not weather_data or 'current_condition' not in weather_data:
            raise ValueError(f"No valid weather data found for {location}. Please check the location and try again.")
        
        return weather_data
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error fetching weather data: {e}")
        return None
    except ValueError as ve:
        print(ve)
        return None


In this version, if the weather data doesn’t include the expected fields or is empty, a ValueError is raised with a clear message for the user. This will help guide the user in case of invalid locations or data retrieval issues.

Me:
That’s perfect! I also want to ensure that if the location is invalid (like a misspelled city), I catch that error and prompt the user again instead of crashing the program. How can I implement that?

AI:
You can add a loop that keeps prompting the user until a valid location is entered. If the location is invalid, the program will display an error and prompt the user again. Here’s how you can do that:

def get_location_input():
    while True:
        location = pyip.inputStr(
            prompt="Enter the city for the weather forecast: ", allowRegexes=[r'^[A-Za-z\s]+$']
        )
        
        # Check if the location is valid by querying the weather API
        weather_data = get_weather_data(location)
        if weather_data:
            return location
        else:
            print(f"Sorry, we couldn't find weather data for {location}. Please try again.")

def display_menu():
    while True:
        print("\nWeather Advisor Menu:")
        print("1. Get Weather Information")
        print("2. Exit")
        
        choice = pyip.inputChoice([1, 2], prompt="Enter your choice: ", caseSensitive=True)
        
        if choice == 1:
            location = get_location_input()
            print(f"You selected {location}. Fetching weather data...")
            # Add code to retrieve and display weather data here
        elif choice == 2:
            print("Exiting Weather Advisor. Goodbye!")
            break


In this version, the get_location_input function keeps asking the user for input until a valid location is provided. If the location is invalid, the program will try again instead of crashing.

Me:
Great! Now I want to make the menu a bit more interactive, with options like viewing weather details for multiple days, getting visualizations, and maybe even exiting. What do you suggest?

AI:
You can expand the menu to include options for showing weather details, generating visualizations, and maybe displaying the forecast for several days. Here’s an enhanced version of the menu:

def display_menu():
    while True:
        print("\nWeather Advisor Menu:")
        print("1. Get Weather Information")
        print("2. View Weather Forecast")
        print("3. Display Temperature Visualization")
        print("4. Display Precipitation Visualization")
        print("5. Exit")
        
        choice = pyip.inputChoice([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], prompt="Enter your choice: ", caseSensitive=True)
        
        if choice == 1:
            location = get_location_input()
            print(f"You selected {location}. Fetching weather data...")
            # Add code to retrieve and display weather data here
        elif choice == 2:
            location = get_location_input()
            print(f"Showing the weather forecast for {location}...")
            # Add code to show forecast here
        elif choice == 3:
            location = get_location_input()
            print(f"Generating temperature visualization for {location}...")
            # Add code to generate temperature visualization
        elif choice == 4:
            location = get_location_input()
            print(f"Generating precipitation visualization for {location}...")
            # Add code to generate precipitation visualization
        elif choice == 5:
            print("Exiting Weather Advisor. Goodbye!")
            break


With this enhanced menu, users can choose to view the weather forecast, view temperature or precipitation visualizations, or exit the program. Each option will trigger the corresponding function.
