Me: What are the advantages and drawbacks of using Open-Meteo versus wttr.in for my student weather assignment?
AI: Open-Meteo offers a free, API-key-free service with detailed daily forecasts and flexible parameters. It requires latitude and longitude but provides accurate multi-day weather data and supports specific weather attributes. wttr.in is simpler with direct city queries and no setup hassle but limits forecasts to 3 days and fewer parameters.

Me: Which API is easier for beginners to integrate using Python?
AI: wttr.in is easier for absolute beginners due to simple URL calls with city names and minimal parameters. Open-Meteo requires handling latitude/longitude and parsing nested JSON but is straightforward enough with basic Python requests usage.

Me: What limitations should I expect from Open-Meteo for this assignment?
AI: The main challenge is that Open-Meteo requires geographic coordinates, not just city names, which means extra steps for converting city names to coordinates. Also, parsing its structured JSON data may add complexity versus wttr.inâ€™s simple output. However, it offers richer forecast details without need for API keys.

Me: Given these points, which do you recommend for a student project?
AI: If simplicity with minimal effort is paramount, wttr.in is the easiest choice. But if you want a more realistic and extensible weather data API without API keys, Open-Meteo is a strong option, especially if you can manage the coordinate lookup step.
