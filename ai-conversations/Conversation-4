Conversation 4: Adding Visualizations and Enhancing User Feedback

Me:
I want to add some visualizations to the weather data. Specifically, I’d like to generate a temperature trend over several days and display a precipitation chart. Can you help me implement these features using matplotlib?

AI:
Sure! matplotlib is great for creating visualizations. We can start by creating a temperature trend and precipitation chart. First, let's handle the temperature trend. We'll assume that the get_weather_data function returns a list of daily temperatures.

Here’s a basic implementation for the temperature visualization:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def create_temperature_visualisation(weather_data, forecast_days=5):
    # Assuming weather_data contains a list of daily weather conditions with temperature
    temperatures = [day["temp"] for day in weather_data["forecast"]["forecastday"][:forecast_days]]
    days = [f"Day {i+1}" for i in range(forecast_days)]
    
    plt.plot(days, temperatures, marker='o', color='b')
    plt.title("Temperature Trend")
    plt.xlabel("Days")
    plt.ylabel("Temperature (°C)")
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()


In this example, create_temperature_visualisation takes weather_data and generates a plot of temperatures for the given number of forecast days. The data is expected to be in the format provided by the weather API.

Me:
This looks good, How about generating a precipitation chart? I want to show how the precipitation changes over the forecast period.

AI:
Sure! For precipitation, we can follow a similar approach as for the temperature trend. Here’s a visualization for precipitation:

def create_precipitation_visualisation(weather_data, forecast_days=5):
    # Assuming weather_data contains daily precipitation information
    precipitation = [day["precipitation"] for day in weather_data["forecast"]["forecastday"][:forecast_days]]
    
    plt.bar(range(forecast_days), precipitation, color='g')
    plt.title("Precipitation Trend")
    plt.xlabel("Days")
    plt.ylabel("Precipitation (mm)")
    plt.xticks(range(forecast_days), [f"Day {i+1}" for i in range(forecast_days)])
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()


In this example, create_precipitation_visualisation plots a bar chart of daily precipitation over the given forecast period. The assumption is that each day in the weather_data includes a precipitation field.

Me:
I’ll integrate these visualizations. I want to make sure the user receives useful feedback throughout the process, especially if something goes wrong. For example, if the weather data is missing or incomplete, I want to notify the user more clearly. What do you recommend?

AI:
You can enhance the error handling by providing more detailed feedback. For instance, if the API response doesn’t contain the expected weather data or the data is incomplete, you can provide a more specific error message based on what’s missing. Here’s an example:

def get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5):
    try:
        url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1"
        response = requests.get(url)
        
        if response.status_code != 200:
            raise ValueError(f"Error: Unable to retrieve data for {location}. Status code: {response.status_code}")
        
        weather_data = response.json()
        
        if 'forecast' not in weather_data or not weather_data['forecast']:
            raise ValueError(f"No forecast data found for {location}. Please check the location or try again later.")
        
        return weather_data
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error fetching weather data: {e}")
        return None
    except ValueError as ve:
        print(ve)
        return None


In this version, if the forecast data is missing, a specific error message is raised to notify the user that the forecast could not be found. You can add more checks based on what data is required for the visualizations.

Me:
That makes sense. I also want to make the app a bit more interactive by allowing the user to select the number of forecast days and whether they want to see a temperature or precipitation chart. Can you help me structure that in the menu?

AI:
Absolutely! You can enhance the menu to give the user more control over the forecast. Here’s how you could implement that:

def display_menu():
    while True:
        print("\nWeather Advisor Menu:")
        print("1. Get Weather Information")
        print("2. View Weather Forecast")
        print("3. Display Temperature Visualization")
        print("4. Display Precipitation Visualization")
        print("5. Select Forecast Days")
        print("6. Exit")
        
        choice = pyip.inputChoice([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], prompt="Enter your choice: ", caseSensitive=True)
        
        if choice == 1:
            location = get_location_input()
            print(f"You selected {location}. Fetching weather data...")
            # Add code to retrieve and display weather data here
        elif choice == 2:
            location = get_location_input()
            print(f"Showing the weather forecast for {location}...")
            # Add code to show forecast here
        elif choice == 3:
            location = get_location_input()
            forecast_days = pyip.inputInt(prompt="Enter the number of forecast days (1-5): ", min=1, max=5)
            print(f"Generating temperature visualization for {location} for the next {forecast_days} days...")
            # Add code to generate temperature visualization
        elif choice == 4:
            location = get_location_input()
            forecast_days = pyip.inputInt(prompt="Enter the number of forecast days (1-5): ", min=1, max=5)
            print(f"Generating precipitation visualization for {location} for the next {forecast_days} days...")
            # Add code to generate precipitation visualization
        elif choice == 5:
            forecast_days = pyip.inputInt(prompt="Enter the number of forecast days (1-5): ", min=1, max=5)
            print(f"Forecast days set to {forecast_days}.")
        elif choice == 6:
            print("Exiting Weather Advisor. Goodbye!")
            break


In this version, the user can select how many days of the forecast they want to see for both temperature and precipitation charts. The number of forecast days is validated using pyinputplus, and the relevant visualization is generated based on the user's choice.

Me:
I also want to make sure that the app handles edge cases where the user may input an invalid number of forecast days, like entering a number outside the range of 1-5. Can we ensure that the app gracefully handles this?

AI:
Yes! The pyinputplus library already ensures that the input is valid within the specified range, but I can show you how to handle other cases, such as when the user inputs a non-integer. Here’s an improved version that handles invalid inputs:

def display_menu():
    while True:
        print("\nWeather Advisor Menu:")
        print("1. Get Weather Information")
        print("2. View Weather Forecast")
        print("3. Display Temperature Visualization")
        print("4. Display Precipitation Visualization")
        print("5. Select Forecast Days")
        print("6. Exit")
        
        choice = pyip.inputChoice([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], prompt="Enter your choice: ", caseSensitive=True)
        
        if choice == 1:
            location = get_location_input()
            print(f"You selected {location}. Fetching weather data...")
            # Add code to retrieve and display weather data here
        elif choice == 2:
            location = get_location_input()
            print(f"Showing the weather forecast for {location}...")
            # Add code to show forecast here
        elif choice == 3:
            location = get_location_input()
            try:
                forecast_days = pyip.inputInt(prompt="Enter the number of forecast days (1-5): ", min=1, max=5)
                print(f"Generating temperature visualization for {location} for the next {forecast_days} days...")
                # Add code to generate temperature visualization
            except pyip.exceptions.RetryLimitException:
                print("Invalid input! Please enter a number between 1 and 5.")
        elif choice == 4:
            location = get_location_input()
            try:
                forecast_days = pyip.inputInt(prompt="Enter the number of forecast days (1-5): ", min=1, max=5)
                print(f"Generating precipitation visualization for {location} for the next {forecast_days} days...")
                # Add code to generate precipitation visualization
            except pyip.exceptions.RetryLimitException:
                print("Invalid input! Please enter a number between 1 and 5.")
        elif choice == 5:
            try:
                forecast_days = pyip.inputInt(prompt="Enter the number of forecast days (1-5): ", min=1, max=5)
                print(f"Forecast days set to {forecast_days}.")
            except pyip.exceptions.RetryLimitException:
                print("Invalid input! Please enter a number between 1 and 5.")
        elif choice == 6:
            print("Exiting Weather Advisor. Goodbye!")
            break


In this version, the program will ask the user to input a valid number of forecast days. If they enter something invalid (like a string or a number outside the specified range), the program will print an error message and ask again.
